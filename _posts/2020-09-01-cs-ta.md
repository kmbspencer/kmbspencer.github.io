Since fall of 2020 I have been a TA (tutor) for the Intrduction to Computer Science course in Python. Each semester has had over 100 students who we engage through nightly drop in hours, and support in lab. Teaching coding helps me solidify my skills in Python, as well as gives me a different perspective on my own courses. I love helping students, and watching them grow in skills and confidence throughout the semester is incredible.
