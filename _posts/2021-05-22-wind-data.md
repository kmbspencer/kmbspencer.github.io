For my final group project in my Introductory Statistics course, we used linear regression techniques to analyze the power generated by wind turbines in the United States. We used the U. S. Wind Turbine Database, which has information on every wind turbine and wind farm in the US. It was exciting to get to use my new skills in statistics and R for this project, but we barely scratched the surface of what the USWTD has to offer. I hope I get to work with this data base again!
