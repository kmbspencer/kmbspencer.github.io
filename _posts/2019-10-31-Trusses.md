For Engineering 270: Mechanics  we were tasked in pairs to create a truss bridge that could hold 5g/N when crushed in the Instrom. While most of the bridges were unable to hold that weight, ours made it to 5.07N/g and was the lightest bridge to do so. It eventually failed by warping in and out of the plane, which was intersting because we had analyzed it as a 2D truss, and applying half of the force. With that analysis, the truss should have been able to withstand about 800N, but in reality, the connections between the two trusses were the weakest part.
