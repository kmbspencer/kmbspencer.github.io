As a final project for Advanced Thermodynamics, I investigated the embodied carbon in the new Neilson Library construction, as part of a broader look at embodied carbon in construction on campus. The embodied carbon in a building is emissions not associated with its operation; that is to say any emissions associated with the making, manufacturing, and transport of the materials. This project gave me a chance to explore an area of sustainability I hadn't learned about before, and was very interesting.
