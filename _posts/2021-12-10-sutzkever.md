 Although neither an artist nor a writer, for the final project JUD 362: The Last Great Yiddish Poet I designed a graphic novel based on the works of Avrom Sutzkever, the poet at the center of the class. Particularly through this remote semester, engaging with poetry and history critically was essential. I especially enjoyed the chance to engage acedemically with graphic novels, which have always been an interest of mine.

 Here are a few of my favorite lines of Sutzkever's poetry.

>Barefoot little wanderer,
>before the smooth salty moisture
>clouds it over, engrave your will
>with a twig on the seashore:
>Thus and thus and thus.
>A wave with pearl wings will swallow it
>and carry it to the roller of waves
>and he will read it.
>Read it, bless it: Let it be as the little wanderer wishes.
>And a rapt, singular smile
>will emerge from the sand, resurrected.


>Sunset on the blue and icy pathways.
>Sweet slumber colors in my heart.
>A little house shines from the valley
>Covered with the snow of sunset.
>Wondrous forests wing across the windows,
>Enchanted sledges jungle round and round.
>In the tiny attic doves are cooing,
>Tracing out my face. And under ice,
>Threaded through with glittering crystals
>The River Irtysh quivers, - real, or dream. 
>Under still and silent domes
>Blooms a world: a seven-year-old child.


>It was worthwhile being born. Indeed it was worthwhile
>Even though you have to bend before a drop of lead.
>And though you are a victim of a tiny microbes might,
>And though you treat yourself so badly, day and night.
