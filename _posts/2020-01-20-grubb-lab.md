Starting in the spring of 2020 I worked in the Grubb Software Engineering Lab developing and implementing additional functionality for the BloomingLeaf, a a web-based tool for modeling and analyzing (Tropos like) formal goal models with evolving intentions.
More information avalible [here](https://amgrubb.github.io/grubb-lab/).

Additionally I revamped the Grubb Lab website, debugged the tool, and collaborated with a team at the University of Montreal on a modeling uncertainty project. 

You can see the poster I made for Celebrating Collaborations [here](https://sophia.smith.edu/celebrating-collaborations/we-see-the-true-colors-sliding-through-evaluation-visualization-with-color/), and read the two papers I co-authored [here](https://kmbspencer.github.io/publication/2021-Towards-a-Generic-Method-for-Articulating-Design-time-Uncertainty) and [here](https://kmbspencer.github.io/publication/2020-Towards-an-Evaluation-Visualization-with-Color).
