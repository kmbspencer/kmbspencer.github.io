Students in Engineering 110: Fundamentals of Engineering all participate in the Lawnmower Engine Lab, where they take apart an old lawnmower engine, meet with a TA to discuss the mass and energy flows that power it, then reassemble the engine. My first year I absolutly loved this project. I enjoyed getting to do something hands on, as well as getting to apply theoretical knowledge to a real peice of machinery. As a TA I enjoy getting to share this project with the first years, while at the same time getting to connect with a new year of engineers! The best part of engineering at Smith is the community, and this possition helps me connect with friends I might not have met otherwise.
