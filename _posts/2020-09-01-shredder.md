In collaboration with the Design Thinking Initiative, and an interdiciplinary team across engineering, design thinking, and environmental science, I built a plastic shredder. This shredder was based on the open source work of [Precious Plastics](https://preciousplastic.com/), but customized the design to fit our specific needs. We had to adapt a lot to work remotely, but this wonderful team worked through the tension and made for a wonderful year. Throughout the project I practiced skills in project management, machine shop fabrication, stakeholder interviews, and even got to weld a little bit! This machine is the start of a bigger project, that will connect the making community across the Valley and hopefully allow for some wonderful things to be made.
