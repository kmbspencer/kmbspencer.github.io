Students in Engineering 110: Fundamentals of Engineering all participate in the Lawnmower Engine Lab, where they take apart an old lawnmower engine, meet with a TA to discuss the mass and energy flows that power it, then reassemble the engine. My first year I absolutly loved this project. I enjoyed getting to do something hands on, as well as getting to apply theoretical knowledge to a real piece of machinery. As a TA I enjoy getting to share this project with the first years, while at the same time getting to connect with a new year of engineers. The best part of engineering at Smith is the community, and this possition helps me connect with friends I might not have met otherwise. 

For the Spring '21 semester, this project was especially valuable as the only in person point of connection for EGR 110. It was incredibly imactful to get to show these students the engineering hall for the first time, as well as give them an oppertunity to meet each other in person at last.
