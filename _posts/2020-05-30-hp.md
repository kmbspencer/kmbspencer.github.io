 At Smith, students most commonly live in houses, dorms of 20-100 with strong communities. My first year, the house coommunity was an important part of my Smith experience, and I wanted to make my house, Parsons, as welcoming as possible.  In the Fall of 2020 I plan to continue my involvement in house community as the House President.

 Developed and maintained welcoming remote community for 45 members of Parsons Residence House
 Lead bi-weekly house council meetings to plan house events and engage remote residents
 Engaged in weekly House Presidents Association meetings advocate for residents
