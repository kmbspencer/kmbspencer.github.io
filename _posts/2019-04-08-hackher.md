At HackHer 2019, together with Jessica Keast and Julia Heinz we demoed a prototype of Daily Role Models, a Chrome extention that customized the users search homepage to include the biography of someone from an underepresnted group in STEM along with links to relevant learning resources. Being only halfway through my intro CS class, with only a prior background of AP CS in Java, building even a simple page with HTML and CSS was a very new experience, let alone adding it to the Chrome Store as an extention. Never the less, working on Daily Role Models was an inspiring experience, as I saw how much I could learn and build in just a few short hours.
