As the culminating project of Engineering 100 Engineering for Everyone: Energy and the Environment the class made a Tiny Town of model houses, set out on the lawn in mid December that had to regulate their own internal temperature using a combination of thermal masses, and servo moters that were able to open doors or hatches. My team built our house inspired by old castle ruins and a Mondrian painting. Our house is still on display in the atrium of Ford Hall at Smith College.
