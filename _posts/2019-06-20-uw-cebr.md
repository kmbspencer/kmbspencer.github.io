 I was a research assistant in the Mackensie Lab in the department of Material Science. This was through the Clean Energy Institute and was their Clean Energy Bridge to Research Program. My project was focused on developing a new solution processing technique for perovskite photovoltaics, as well as shadowing and assisting in various other work relating to perovskites.
