 At Smith, students most commonly live in houses, dorms of 20-100 with strong communities. My first year, the house coommunity was an important part of my Smith experience, and I wanted to make my house, Parsons, as welcoming as possible for the incoming class! As a Head of New Students (HONS) I helped with move in, ran house events, and generally was a friendly face to the class of 2023. <br> In the Fall of 2020 I plan to continue my involvement in house community as the House President.
