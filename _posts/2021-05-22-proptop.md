For my final project of Fluid Dynamics, I investegated the feasability of a phone charger made from a propeller hat. Though a little silly, it was very fun to be able to take serious analytical and testing concepts and apply them to real world "problems" (although, not being able to charge your phone by propeller hat is only a problem in the loosest sense). I used the wind tunnel, and was able to compare results both experimentally and through calculations. To summarize in breif: this wouldn't really work.
