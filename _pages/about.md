I am a junior engineering major and computer science minor at Smith College. My primary interest is in renewable energy, but I am also passionate about computer science, design, and building communities. I am a research assistant for [Alica Grubb](amgrubb.github.io), tutor for engineering and computer science, and am a "House President" for my dorm. Outside of academics I enjoy reading, crafting, and singing.
